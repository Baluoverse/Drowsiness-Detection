# Drowsiness-Detection

The provided script is designed to monitor and alert for drowsiness based on the eye aspect ratio (EAR). It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to achieve this. The script begins by importing necessary libraries such as `cv2` for computer vision, `dlib` for face detection, and `playsound` for audio alerts. The core functionality revolves around detecting eye closure: it calculates the EAR, a metric derived from the distances between various eye landmarks, to determine if the eyes are closed. If the EAR falls below a predefined threshold for a certain number of consecutive frames, it indicates potential drowsiness. The system then plays an alert sound and displays a warning message on the video feed. The `alert_thread` function manages displaying messages and keeps them visible for a brief period. The main loop captures video frames, processes them to detect faces and calculate EAR, and handles alerts accordingly. If the camera feed is interrupted or the user presses 'q', the program exits gracefully. This script provides a practical solution for monitoring alertness, especially useful in contexts like driver monitoring or work environments requiring sustained attention.
